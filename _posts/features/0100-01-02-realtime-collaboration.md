Substance has a strong focus on collaboration. That means people should be able to work on a document together very easily, even in realtime.

# Operations

Documents are transformed through atomic operations, which allows us to implement interesting things, such as realtime updates and patches.

# Collaborative editing in realtime

You can invite other Substance users to co-author your document. Changes made by others appear in realtime on the document.

# Comments

Everyone (including readers) can add comments to a document and refer to a particular fraction of content.

# Patches

Every reader should be enabled to contribute. While readers can't edit the document directly, they're able to make changes and submit them as a patch. Patches are then reviewed by original authors and can easily be applied to the document.
