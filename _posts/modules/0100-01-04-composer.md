The [Substance Composer](http://github.com/substance/composer) is a foundation for building your own editor tailored for you particular usecase. That's because we've made a claim:

> Building a web-based content editor for everyone is impossible

And proposed a solution:

> Provide an easy way for communities to build their own editor


You can extend basic content types such as Text, Sections and Images with custom types such as Maps, Formulas, or pre-structured types such as an Event content type that allows you entering name, date, organizer etc. You can add whatever you can imagine, the sky is the limit. But here comes the bummer: You need to do it yourself. Our mission is to make it very easy for you, by creating an infrastructure for basic operations such as inserting, moving and deleting nodes, and a generic UI for dealing with patches and comments.

# Collaboration

Since collaboration is more imporantant than ever before to create high quality content the Substance Composer not only supports comments, but also the concept of patches to turn every reader into a potential collaborator.


# Extensibility

It's easy for developers to add their own node types. We'll provide a tutorial on this as soon as possible.

# API

Documents are manipulated using operations, which are represented as JSON. By keeping track of atomic document operations, the complete history can be replayed and allows users to go back and forth in time. You can either use the web-based editor for manipulating documents, or do it programmatically using the API.


## Nodes

Commands for inserting, updating, moving and deleting content nodes. A `Substance.Node` is an abstract interface for concrete elements that can be placed on the document. Those can be:

- Text
- Section
- Image
- etc.

You can create your own as well. But you have to make sure they support the Node interface.


### node:insert

Insert a new node.


    {
      "command": "node:insert", 
      "user": "michael",
      "type": "text",
      "rev": 3,
      "attributes": {"content": "Text goes here."}
    }


### node:move

Move node(s). They are inserted after a specified target node.


    {
      "command": "node:move", 
      "user": "michael",
      "nodes": ["/section/2", "/text/3"],
      "target": "/text/5"
      "rev": 12
    }


### node:select

Make a new node selection.

    {
      "command": "node:select",
      "user": "michael",
      "nodes": ["/section/2", "/text/3"],
      "rev": 12
    }


### node:update

Updates the contents of a node, which can specified within the `data` property.


    {
      "command": "node:update",
      "node": "/text/1",
      "data": { ... },
      "rev": 12
    }

### node:delete

Removes an existing node from the document


    {
      "command": "node:delete",
      "node": "/section/3",
      "rev": 12
    }

## Comments

Comments can be added very easily by opening the command tab and hitting New Comment. They are listed chronologically and turn the document into an active discussion. Every comment can refer to a certain part of the document. This means that while writing your comment you can make a selection in the document which then gets associated with that comment.


### comment:insert

Adds a new comment to the document. `position` is optional and describes where the comment belongs to within one node. For instance start and end properties can describe the selection within a text node. 


    {
      "command": "comment:insert",
      "user": "michael",
      "node": "/text/4",
      "position": {"start": 10, "end": 27} // optional
      "rev": 12
    }

## Patches

Patches are the most interesting part and enable everyone making changes to a document, and submit them as a patch. The authors can then review that patch and apply it to the document.

### patch:insert

Takes an array of operations, reflecting all changes that have been made. Those can later be applied on the document.


    {
      "command": "patch:insert",
      "user": "michael",
      "operations": [
      	{ "command": "node:insert", ... },
        { "command": "node:update", ... }
      ]
      "rev": 12
    }


### patch:apply

Applies a particular patch to the document. This operation may fail, as there can be conflicts with the existing document.

    {
      "command": "patch:insert",
      "user": "michael",
      "patch": "/patch/1",
      "rev": 12
    }
