The Substance Library is different from traditional libraries, in that there are no books stored but digital documents that are always up-to-date. Everyone with permission can read and write documents at any time. Open 24/7.


# API

It's fairly easy to use.


## Write Document

    $ curl -XPOST http://localhost:7007/write -d '{
        "id": the-substance-composer,
        "created_at": "2012-04-10T15:17:28.946Z",
        "updated_at": "2012-04-10T15:17:28.946Z",
        "head": "/cover/1",
        "tail": "/section/2",
        "rev": 2,
        "nodes": {
          "/cover/1": {
            "type": ["/type/node", "/type/cover"],
            "title": "The Substance Composer",
            "abstract": "Building an editor for everyone is impossible. Go create your own.",
            "next": "/section/2",
            "prev": null
          },
          "/section/2": {
            "type": ["/type/node", "/type/section"],
            "name": "Start typing today.",
            "prev": "/cover/1",
            "next": null
          }
        },
        "operations": [
          {"command": "node:insert", "params": {"user": "michael", "type": "cover", "attributes": {"title": "The Substance Composer" }}},
